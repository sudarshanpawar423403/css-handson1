    <h2>What is Css?</h2>

    <div>
        <ol>
        <li class="my-container">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. </li>
        <li class="my-container">CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li class="my-container"><span id="a"><strong>Css is not necessary</strong></span><span id="c"><strong>Css saves lot of work.

        </strong></span>
            <span>It can control the layout of multiple pages all at once</span></li>
        <li class="my-container" id="b">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
        </ol>

    </div>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <div>
        <ul>
        <li style="letter-spacing:5px ; color:brown">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li id="internal">Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li id="external">External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li id="s">The most common way to add css, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, 
            <Span id="span"><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b>
                 </Span> because this is easier to demostrate, 
            and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="para">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. 
        ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can 
        use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. </p>

    <p class="para">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.
         Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be apllied to the element. </p>

    <p class="para">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to targeted
       elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
